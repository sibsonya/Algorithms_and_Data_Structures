1. *vertex_cover_forest.cpp*

   Algorithm for finding the minimum vertex coverage of the forest
   **Input format**
   The first line contains the number of vertices V (0 < V <= 1000). Each of the following  V lines describes an adjacency list of a vertex u that is next in order and consists of the number of adjacent vertices d(u) (0 < d(u) <= 1000) and the ordered list of adjacent vertices following this number. Vertices are numbered from scratch.
   **Output format**
   Minimum vertex coverage size.
